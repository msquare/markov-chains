markov-chains - A Markov chain implementation in Java
=====================================================

I created this mainly as an exercise in doing TDD. If you want to know what all this markov-business is about I suggest you read this excellent article on Coding Horror: [Markov and You](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/06/markov-and-you.html) or the somewhat scientific explanation on Wikipedia: [Markov chain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)
